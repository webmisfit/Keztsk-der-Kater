<p style=font-weight:bold>3 impostazioni di temperatura</p>
<p>Il sistema di riscaldamento può essere impostato in tre diverse modalità a seconda della temperatura esterna:<br>
ECONOMIA - mantiene a  lungo una temperatura confortevole sia al chiuso sia all'aperto.<br>
COMFORT - per condizioni di tempertura normali.<br>
TURBO - alle basse temperature.
</p><br>
<p style=font-weight:bold>Frosted Button incorporato</p>
<p>Si passa da una modalità all'altra tramite il pulsante Frosted Button. È sufficiente premere una volta e l'intensità del riscaldamento cambia.</p><br>
<p style=font-weight:bold>Lavabile in lavatrice!</p>
<p>La giacca termica può essere   lavata in   lavatrice. L'interno è realizzato in fibra di carbonio e il pulsante di accensione è isolato e impermeabile.</p><br>
<p style=font-weight:bold>Riscaldamento diretto della schiena e del ventre.</p>
<p>La giacca si riscalda a 31°C in 1 minuto. Per evitare il raffreddore  la schiena deve essere al caldo. Potrai fare una passeggiata in tutta tranquillità.</p><br>
<p style=font-weight:bold>La batteria dura fino a 10 ore.</p>
<p>La durata della batteria è direttamente correlata alla modalità selezionata. In condizioni di bassa intensità  la durata è di 8-10 ore, a media intensità di 6-8 ore e ad alta intensità di 4-6 ore.</p><br>

<h4>Angelo Russo, 31 anni</h4>
<p>L'ho ordinato un mese fa,  la giacca è stata consegnata velocemente, in soli tre giorni. Conduco un stile di vita attivo, amo  la pesca. Mi piace anche andare in moto con i miei amici. La giacca ha soddisfatto pienamente  le mie aspettative! Lo consiglio!</p>

<h4>Giuseppe Chiacchio, 45 anni</h4>
<p>Lo adoro! Questo è il mio miglior acquisto online! Il materiale è ottimo,  le serrature e il pulsante sono di alta qualità. La carica dura molto a  lungo. Dopo il  lavaggio è rimasto come nuovo. Ne ho ordinato un altro per mio figlio!</p>

<h4>Francesco Vergara, 39 anni</h4>
<p>Ho amato sciare fin da quando ero bambino, ma non mi piacciono proprio questi vestiti pesanti che ti fanno stancare. La giacca pesa 500 grammi, è difficile percepirla. Il riscaldamento funziona molto bene. Lo consiglio!</p>
